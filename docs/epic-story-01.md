# User Story 1: OIDC Protocol Implementation

## Description
As a developer, I need to implement the core OIDC protocol so that the server can handle standard OIDC authentication flows.

## Tasks and Implementation Details

### 1. Implement authorization endpoint
- Create a new view in Django for the authorization endpoint
- Implement OAuth 2.0 authorization code flow
- Handle user authentication and consent
- Generate and return authorization code

Implementation Notes:
- Created a new file `sso_server/oidc/views.py` with an `authorize` view function
- Implemented user authentication check using `@login_required` decorator
- Added consent handling for users who haven't previously consented to the client
- Utilized `django-oidc-provider`'s `AuthorizeEndpoint` for parameter validation and response creation
- Created a template `sso_server/templates/oidc/authorize.html` for the consent page
- Updated `sso_server/urls.py` to include the new OIDC URLs

### 2. Implement token endpoint
- Create a new view in Django for the token endpoint
- Implement token issuance for various grant types (authorization_code, refresh_token, etc.)
- Validate client credentials and authorization codes
- Generate and return access tokens, ID tokens, and refresh tokens

### 3. Implement userinfo endpoint
- Create a new view in Django for the userinfo endpoint
- Implement token validation
- Return user claims based on the scope of the access token

### 4. Support for standard OIDC scopes
- Implement support for openid, profile, email, and other standard OIDC scopes
- Create a mechanism to manage and validate requested scopes
- Ensure that only authorized scopes are included in tokens and userinfo responses

### 5. Implement OIDC discovery endpoint
- Create a new view in Django for the .well-known/openid-configuration endpoint
- Implement the discovery document containing server metadata
- Include information about endpoints, supported scopes, and other OIDC features

## Implementation Notes
- Utilize the django-oidc-provider library as a foundation for the OIDC implementation
- Ensure compliance with the OpenID Connect Core 1.0 specification
- Implement proper error handling and logging for all endpoints
- Use secure communication (HTTPS) for all OIDC-related endpoints
- Implement rate limiting and other security measures to prevent abuse

## Testing
- Develop unit tests for each endpoint and core functionality
- Implement integration tests to verify the complete OIDC flow
- Test with various OIDC clients to ensure compatibility

## Security Considerations
- Implement proper token signing and validation
- Use secure random number generation for all tokens and codes
- Implement proper CORS (Cross-Origin Resource Sharing) policies
- Ensure all sensitive data is properly encrypted at rest and in transit

## Next Steps
- After implementing the core OIDC protocol, proceed with the pseudonym generation system (User Story 2) to enhance privacy features
- Consider implementing additional OIDC features such as dynamic client registration and revocation endpoints in future iterations

## Progress
- [x] Implement authorization endpoint
- [ ] Implement token endpoint
- [ ] Implement userinfo endpoint
- [ ] Support for standard OIDC scopes
- [ ] Implement OIDC discovery endpoint
