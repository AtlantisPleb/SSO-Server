# Pseudonym Management System Implementation Plan

## Overview
This plan outlines the steps to implement a pseudonym management system in our SSO server. The goal is to create unique pseudonyms for each user-vendor pair, ensuring that vendors never have access to the real usernames or IDs of our users.

## Steps

### 1. Database Schema Updates
- Create a new `Vendor` model
- Create a new `Pseudonym` model
- Update existing models if necessary

### 2. Model Implementation
- Implement the `Vendor` model
- Implement the `Pseudonym` model
- Add necessary relationships and constraints

### 3. Authentication Flow Modifications
- Update the login process to create or retrieve pseudonyms
- Modify the OIDC token generation to use pseudonyms

### 4. OIDC Endpoint Updates
- Update the userinfo endpoint to return pseudonyms instead of real user IDs
- Modify any other endpoints that expose user information

### 5. Pseudonym Generation and Management
- Implement a secure method for generating unique pseudonyms
- Create a system for managing and potentially rotating pseudonyms

### 6. Vendor Integration
- Update the vendor registration process to include necessary information for pseudonym management
- Implement a system to associate OIDC clients with vendors

### 7. Testing
- Unit tests for new models and functions
- Integration tests for the updated authentication flow
- End-to-end tests simulating vendor interactions

### 8. Documentation
- Update API documentation to reflect changes in user identification
- Create guides for vendors on how to integrate with the new pseudonym system

### 9. Security Audit
- Conduct a thorough security review of the pseudonym system
- Ensure that there are no ways to correlate pseudonyms across vendors

### 10. Data Migration
- Develop a plan for migrating existing users and their data to the new system
- Create and test migration scripts

### 11. Deployment
- Plan a phased rollout of the new system
- Prepare rollback procedures in case of unforeseen issues

### 12. Monitoring and Maintenance
- Implement logging for pseudonym-related activities
- Set up alerts for any suspicious activities related to pseudonym usage

## Timeline
- Planning and Design: 1 week
- Implementation (Steps 1-6): 2-3 weeks
- Testing and Security Audit (Steps 7-9): 1-2 weeks
- Documentation and Migration Planning (Steps 8, 10): 1 week
- Deployment and Initial Monitoring (Steps 11-12): 1 week

Total Estimated Time: 6-8 weeks

## Resources Needed
- Backend Developer(s)
- Database Administrator
- Security Specialist
- QA Engineer
- Technical Writer

## Risks and Mitigations
- Data Integrity: Ensure robust error handling and transaction management
- Performance: Index the pseudonym table and optimize queries
- Security: Regular security audits and penetration testing
- Vendor Adoption: Provide clear documentation and support for vendors during transition

## Next Steps
1. Review and approve this implementation plan
2. Assign resources and create detailed tasks
3. Begin with the database schema updates and model implementations
